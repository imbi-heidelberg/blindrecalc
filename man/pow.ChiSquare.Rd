\usage{
\S4method{pow}{ChiSquare}(
  design,
  n1,
  nuisance,
  recalculation,
  allocation = c("exact", "approximate", "kf_approx"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{Object of class \code{ChiSquare} created by \code{setupChiSquare}.}

\item{n1}{Either the sample size of the first stage (if
\code{recalculation = TRUE} or the toal sample size (if
\code{recalculation = FALSE}).}

\item{nuisance}{Value of the nuisance parameter. For the
Chi-Squared test this is the overall response rate.}

\item{recalculation}{Should the sample size be recalcuated after n1
patients are recruited?}

\item{allocation}{Whether the allocation ratio should be preserved
exactly (\code{exact}) or approximately (\code{approximate}
or \code{kf_approx}). \code{appproximate} uses the unrounded calculated
sample size in the sample size recalculation, \code{kf_approx}
rounds the sample size to the next integer.}

\item{...}{Further optional arguments.}
}
\value{
one power value for every nuisance parameter
}
\description{
Calculates the power of designs with blinded sample size recalculation
or of fixed designs for one or several values of the nuisance parameter.

\examples{
  d <- setupChiSquare(alpha = 0.025, beta = 0.2, r = 1, delta = 0.2)
  pow(d, n1 = 20, nuisance = c(0.2, 0.4), recalculation = TRUE)
