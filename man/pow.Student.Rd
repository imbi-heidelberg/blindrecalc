\usage{
\S4method{pow}{Student}(
  design,
  n1,
  nuisance,
  recalculation = TRUE,
  iters = 10000,
  seed = NULL,
  allocation = c("approximate", "exact"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{Object of class \code{Student} created by \code{setupStudent}.}

\item{n1}{Either the sample size of the first stage (if
\code{recalculation = TRUE} or the toal sample size (if
\code{recalculation = FALSE}).}

\item{nuisance}{Value of the nuisance parameter. For the
Student's t-test this is the variance.}

\item{recalculation}{Should the sample size be recalculated after n1
n1 patients are recruited?}

\item{iters}{Number of simulation iterations.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for simulation.}

\item{allocation}{Whether the allocation ratio should be preserved
exactly (\code{exact}) or approximately (\code{approximate}).}

\item{...}{Further optional arguments.}
}
\value{
One power value for every nuisance parameter and every value of n1.
}
\description{
Calculates the power of designs with blinded sample size recalculation
or of fixed designs for one or several values of the nuisance parameter.
}
\details{
The method is only vectorized in either \code{nuisance}
  or \code{n1}.
